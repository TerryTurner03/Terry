    <h2>Career trajectory</h2>
     <p>In two years I see myself going to PV (Praririe View) with the major of biochemisty or health science, and the <b>slight</b> chance of me taking a year off to get my life situated. Getting there shouldnt be that hard, if I am at Cass then I can try to get a better chance to it, at least thats my hope.. Five years is bringing me to 22, having my bachelor's degree in Biochemistry. Great ! Hard work and manifestation are most likely going to be a <strong>strong</strong> factor in getting me there. </p>
